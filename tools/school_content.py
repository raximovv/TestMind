u"""How school feels: eleven subjects asked three ways.

WHY THIS IS NOT "WHICH SUBJECTS ARE YOU GOOD AT"
------------------------------------------------
subjects.py already models what a student can DO, from marks, and says plainly
that a mark beats an opinion. This bank asks something a mark cannot see. Two
students with a 5 in mathematics are not the same student if one of them dreads
every lesson, and the one who dreads it will not choose it at eighteen no matter
what the mark says.

So each subject is asked three times, on the three legs of expectancy-value:

    ability     can I do this                 "even the hard parts"
    interest    do I want to do this          "I look forward to the lesson"
    cost        what does it take out of me   "I am anxious even when prepared"

Cost is the leg that is usually left out, and it is the one that explains the
student who is good at a subject and drops it anyway. It is REVERSE scored: a
high answer is a high cost, which counts against the subject, not for it.

ELEVEN SUBJECTS, THIRTY THREE ITEMS, GENERATED NOT TYPED
--------------------------------------------------------
Every item is one of three sentence frames with a subject name in it, so the
items are built here rather than listed. Typing thirty three sentences by hand
in three languages is thirty three chances for Uzbek chemistry to be asked about
interest while Russian chemistry is asked about cost. Generating them makes that
impossible: the frames are translated once and the keying is shared.

THE SUBJECT ORDER ROTATES BETWEEN SECTIONS
------------------------------------------
Asked in one order, a student meets mathematics three times in a row and starts
answering the pattern instead of the question. Each section therefore starts one
subject further along the list, which is not an arbitrary choice: with N
subjects a rotation of k leaves N - k questions between the closest repeated
pair, so the SMALLER the rotation the further apart a subject's three questions
end up. A rotation of one is the best a rotation can do, and it puts ten
questions between one mention of a subject and the next. school_check.py asserts
the distance rather than the shift, because the distance is the thing that
matters and the shift is only how it is obtained.
